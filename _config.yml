  Hi, I am Laís Lavra, a high energy physicist from Brazil, currently living in France. 
  <br><br>
  My research interests are flavour physics, particle tracking detectors and machine learning applications in particle physics.
  <br><br>
  I have a PhD in Particle Physics from <a href="https://www.gov.br/cbpf/pt-br">CBPF</a>, with research focused on studying 
  differences between matter and antimatter in particles containing beauty quarks with the <a href="https://lhcb-outreach.web.cern.ch/">LHCb experiment</a> at <a href="https://home.cern/">CERN</a> in Switzerland. 
  <br><br>
  I am also a former Postdoctoral Fellow at <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/">CNRS</a>, in France, where my work focused on 
  searching for rare decays and commissioning the new scintillating fibre tracker for the <a href="https://lhcb-outreach.web.cern.ch/">LHCb experiment</a>.
