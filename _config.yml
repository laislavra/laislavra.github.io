  My name is La√≠s Lavra and I am a particle physicist and data scientist from Brazil, currently living in France. 
  I have a PhD in Physics from <a href="https://www.gov.br/cbpf/pt-br">CBPF</a>, with a thesis focused on studying 
  differences between matter and antimatter in particles containing beauty and up quarks with the LHCb experiment at CERN in Switzerland. 
  <br><br>
  I am a former Postdoctoral Fellow at <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/">CNRS</a>, in France where my research focused on 
  searching for rare decays and commissioning the new scintillating fibre tracker for the upgrade of the LHCb experiment.
